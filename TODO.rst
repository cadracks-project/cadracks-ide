Adapt to cadracks-core

Todo UI
-------

******** Launcher must be executable

Better graph display
  Selectable nodes, coordinated with 3d view
  OR
  Vue 3D du graphe en fonction de critères (volume = f(volume piece), volume = f(prix), couleur=f(createur))
  Boule = pièce, boite = assemblage ....

  -> selection sync between 3D and graph

Gérer DataFrame général? -> ne pas parcourir le graphe à chaque requête!

-> Extend stepzip concept to igeszip and stlzip
  More complex than expected. ccad limits us to solid, compound and compsolid for imports
  Real cad projects may have to import shells/surfaces

-> Use a correct nomenclature for everything in sample projects
     Re-read docs nomenclature
     Correct problems in sample projects

Resizing problems of 3d viewer

Pre-compute simple representations of files that take a long time to load

Save button for code Enable/Disable depending on what is loaded
